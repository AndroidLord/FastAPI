### FastAPI API Project
## Description
This project is a robust social media API built using FastAPI and Python, providing essential functionalities for user management, post creation, and a voting system.The API incorporates user authentication, relational databases, and various endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts.

## Demo/Project
🔗 Check out the API in action [link](https://fastapi-example-713q.onrender.com/docs)

## Features
Post Operations: CRUD functionalities for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts.
Voting System: Implement a sophisticated voting/like system for posts.
Authentication: Secure endpoints with user authentication using JWT tokens.

## Technology Used
FastAPI: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
Python: The core language driving the application.
PostgreSQL: Utilized as the backend database to store user data and posts.

## Future Scope
Enhanced Security: Implement additional security measures and user verification.
Extended Features: Add more features such as comments, notifications, and user interactions.
Scalability: Optimize the API for increased performance and scalability.
